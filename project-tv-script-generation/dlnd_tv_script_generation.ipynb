    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",
    " - `__init__` - The initialize function. \n",
    " - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state\n",
    " - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to stack the outputs of the lstm to pass to your fully-connected layer, you can do this with `lstm_output = lstm_output.contiguous().view(-1, self.hidden_dim)`\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    " * Originally, there were a few general considerations that guided us in choosing specific values for the key hyperparameters:\n",
    "     * Considering a fairly modest size of the vocabulary of the provided text corpus (21388), it made sense to use a lower value for the `embedding_dim` than in our previous RNN-related projects (e.g., \"Word2Vec\", \"Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\"). So, for the sake of reducing the computational cost we chose `embedding_dim = 200`.\n",
    "     * Based on the [\"Tips and Tricks\" from Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn#tips-and-tricks), we decided to use three LSTM layers in our network (`n_layers = 3`). It seemed like a good idea to be ambitious with the model complexity from the very beginning, even at the risk of overfitting: at least we would have an opportunity to find out early on \"how much is too much\". \n",
    "     * We also used a fairly \"agressive\" value for the learning rate (`learning_rate = 0.01`); we hoped that it would expedite the learing process, at least at the beginning. \n",
    "     * `sequence_length = 12`: Using 12 words to predict the next one appeared to be a good starting point (The choice of this parameter is a result of a trade-off: Choose too few words, and you risk to loose some of the context; choose too many, and you drive the computational cost up, plus you increase the possibility of adding some irrelevant, \"out-of-scope\" words).\n",
    "     * `batch_size = 300`: This value was chosen to be pretty high for the sake of expediting the training process.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    " * Observing the behavior of the loss during the training process provided us with some clues as to what values for the key hyperparameters would work better. Here is what we found after several attempts to train the model:\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. At first, we tried the following values that determine the \"complexity\" of our neural network (see the comments above)\n",
    " :\n",
    "     * `embedding_dim = 200`\n",
    "     * `hidden_dim = 256`\n",
    "     * `n_layers = 3`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  However, after training the model for just two epochs, we saw that the training loss had reached a saturation point: the loss curve got virtually flat. That behavior was a clear sign that our model was underfitting, i.e., it failed to capture and recognize more complex patterns in the data, which in turn drastically limited its performance. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. Thus, we were forced to update the hyperparameters as follows:\n",
    "     * `embedding_dim = 300`\n",
    "     * `hidden_dim = 512`\n",
    "     * `n_layers = 3`\n",
    "     \n",
    "     However, we discovered that having a high learning rate (0.01) leads to a \"wrong\" dynamics of the training loss: it was actually climbing up instead of going down as we would normally expect.\n",
    "     \n",

By the end of the training (10 epochs), the training loss was as low as 3.42 and thus, we passed another major requirement in the Project's rubric. The entire training run took just under 2 hours of GPU time in the project Workspace. "

    "> \n",
    "> I hope the review helped you. If you feel there's something more that you would have preferred from this review please leave a comment. That would immensely help me to improve feedback for any future reviews I conduct including for further projects. Would appreciate your input too. Thanks!\n",

    "## All Required Files and Tests\n",
    "### The project submission contains the project notebook, called “dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb”.\n",
    "\n",
    "### All the unit tests in project have passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-processing Data\n",
    "### The function create_lookup_tables create two dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Dictionary to go from the words to an id, we'll call vocab_to_int\n",
    " * Dictionary to go from the id to word, we'll call int_to_vocab\n",
    "The function create_lookup_tables return these dictionaries as a tuple (vocab_to_int, int_to_vocab).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Good work! You correctly established the two dictionaries.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Also, here's a good resource if you wish to understand word embeddings a bit more as well - http://veredshwartz.blogspot.in/2016/01/representing-words.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### The function token_lookup returns a dict that can correctly tokenizes the provided symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Good job.\n",

    "> \n",
    "> You utilized a for loop to create your array and fill the indices with the required values.\n",

    "> Do you think you could complete this step without using a for loop and only using numpy? Numpy is optimized to handle complex operations so that you don't usually require loops and is faster as a result. So, try it out and see if you can optimize your code or not :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the function batch_data, data is converted into Tensors and formatted with TensorDataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Great job!\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For your own benefit, you could also try to create your own function which utilizes Python Generators. If you haven't worked with Generators before, I highly recommend you try them out for batching the data instead of using TensorDataset and DataLoader. Generators probably don't offer any \"distinct\" advantages over the two, but it's a good python concept to be familiar with as per me.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Here's a couple of resources on generators that I found useful when I was trying to learn them -\n",

    "> \n",
    "> Excellent work!\n",
    "> \n",
    "> I have some questions for you to think about that might benefit you -\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Does your nn.Linear() layer require any activation function?\n",
    "> If you wanted to expand your class to be more generic such that you could have any number of layers you wanted, how would you go about that? Is that required (not just for this project, but for a general implementation which you could use anywhere for example)\n",
    "> Are you familiar with Batch Normalization, yet? It's alright if not as I think you will come across this in the Classroom soon. But look it up and see how it compares to dropouts and whether they are useful for RNNs.\n",
    "> The reason for the above questions is to try to make sure you are ready to explore alternatives. Often, Udacity's helper code tends to tie us down a bit and we restrict ourselves from exploring further. So try to think about the above and get the answers even if they don't seem valid for this project! :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The RNN must include an LSTM or GRU and at least one fully-connected layer. The LSTM/GRU should be correctly initialized, where relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Nicely done!\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Especially for using the Embedding Layer. Have you checked out the documentation for it? Check it out - https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#embedding and try to play around with some of the additional parameters for this method.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Also, here's a good resource if you wish to understand word embeddings a bit as well - http://veredshwartz.blogspot.in/2016/01/representing-words.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## RNN Training\n",
    " * Enough epochs to get near a minimum in the training loss, no real upper limit on this. Just need to make sure the training loss is low and not improving much with more training.\n",
    " * Batch size is large enough to train efficiently, but small enough to fit the data in memory. No real “best” value here, depends on GPU memory usually.\n",
    " * Embedding dimension, significantly smaller than the size of the vocabulary, if you choose to use word embeddings\n",
    " * Hidden dimension (number of units in the hidden layers of the RNN) is large enough to fit the data well. Again, no real “best” value.\n",
    " * n_layers (number of layers in a GRU/LSTM) is between 1-3.\n",
    " * The sequence length (seq_length) here should be about the size of the length of sentences you want to look at before you generate the next word.\n",
    " * The learning rate shouldn’t be too large because the training algorithm won’t converge. But needs to be large enough that training doesn’t take forever.\n",
    "> You selected a good set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * You get a low training loss with the number of epochs, which is good. We should tend to select the number of epochs such that you get a low training loss which reaches kind of a steady-state (not much change in value beyond a point).\n",
    "> * I would recommend that you use a smaller batch size. Try to observe what happens if you lower it or increase it, first. Smaller batch sizes take too long to train. Larger batch sizes speed up the training but can degrade the quality of the model. Here is a useful resource to understand this better - http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/164876/tradeoff-batch-size-vs-number-of-iterations-to-train-a-neural-network Also, do you think the batch size should be a power of 2 (like 16, 32, 64, etc) or your value of 300 is fine? Do you think these DL frameworks and tools are optimized to use values that are powers of 2 because of the hardware?\n",
    "> * Your current RNN size (number of layers) fits the data well. What results do you think you will get when you increase or decrease that? First try increasing and see if your model converges better and has a lower loss or not. Changing this is limited to your system configuration as well, so you might not be able to have a very high value either.\n",
    "> * Usually, we select the sequence length so that it matches the structure of data we are working with. There isn't really a rule of thumb though -http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/158834/what-is-a-feasible-sequence-length-for-an-rnn-to-model. For a tougher challenge, try to think of having variable sequence lengths. https://towardsdatascience.com/taming-lstms-variable-sized-mini-batches-and-why-pytorch-is-good-for-your-health-61d35642972e might help in this regard.\n",
    "> * Good selection for the learning rate!\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Couple of good things for you to try out - a slightly smaller learning rate with more epochs. As you can see your loss seems to still decrease, that means your model seems to still be learning so you can train for more epochs. But at the same time your learning rate results in the loss being a bit spiky (increases and decreases a bit). That usually means a higher learning rate. So you can try to reduce that as well.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Good work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The printed loss should decrease during training. The loss should reach a value lower than 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Excellent job! You can still experiment more with your hyperparameters, if you'd like to. But you are getting good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There is a provided answer that justifies choices about model size, sequence length, and other parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Well explained. You are starting to get an intuitive understanding of working with RNNs/LSTMs 🙂\n",
    "\n",
    "> But I would recommend focussing less on expediting the training and more on understanding the fundamentals around hyperparameter tuning as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generate TV Script\n",
    "### The generated script can vary in length, and should look structurally similar to the TV script in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It doesn’t have to be grammatically correct or make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Your generated script looks awesome! :clap:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Question for you to think about - How do you think you could design your model so that you can control how many words per dialogue your script has? Do you think that's possible with just deep learning?"
